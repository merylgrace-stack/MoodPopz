# MoodPopz - Feature Guide

MoodPopz is a mood regulation app designed to provide immediate, actionable relief for various emotional states. It combines psychology-based micro-tasks with a calming aesthetic and AI-powered support.

## Core Features

### 1. Mood Selection & The "Small Thing" Engine
- **Concept**: When you're overwhelmed, deciding "what to do" is hard. MoodPopz removes that friction.
- **How it works**:
    1.  **Select a Mood**: Choose from 12 distinct moods (e.g., Anxious, Tired, Sad, Hyper, Numb).
    2.  **Spin the Wheel**: The app curates a specific list of "micro-tasks" tailored to that mood.
    3.  **Get a Task**: You receive ONE simple, actionable task (e.g., "Drink a glass of water", "Do 5 jumping jacks").
- **Why**: Breaking the paralysis of analysis helps you take the first small step toward feeling better.

### 2. The 4-Phase Flow
The app guides you through a specific sequence to ground you:
1.  **Mood Phase**: Identify how you feel.
2.  **Wheel Phase**: Surrender control to the wheel (gamification).
3.  **Task Phase**: Focus solely on the assigned task. A dedicated screen removes all other distractions.
4.  **Quote Phase**: After marking the task "Done", you receive a validating, uplifting quote as a reward.

### 3. Streak & Progress Tracking
- **Streak Ring**: A visual ring on the home screen fills up as you complete tasks.
- **Daily & Weekly Tracking**: The app counts your "Daily Streak" (consecutive days) and "Weekly Active Days".
- **Visual Rewards**: Completing tasks triggers confetti and ring animations to release dopamine.
- **Local Storage**: Your stats are saved privately on your device.

### 4. Ambient Soundscapes
- **Healing Frequencies**: Toggle between **528Hz** (Miracle Tone) and **432Hz** (Earth Tone) background frequencies.
- **Visualizer**: An audio-reactive waveform moves in sync with the sound, creating a mesmerizing visual anchor.
- **Volume Control**: High-quality audio loops that start gently.

### 5. Mood Insights Dashboard
Accessible via Settings > "Mood Insights 📊".
- **30-Day Trend Graph**: A visual line graph shows your mood history over the last month.
    - Moods are scored (1=Sad/Angry, 5=Happy/Hyper) to visualize your emotional trajectory.
- **Smart Analysis**: The app calculates the "Slope" of your mood.
    - **Decline Detection**: If your mood is trending down significantly, the app proactively nudges you to check in.

### 6. Privacy-First AI Companion
Accessible via Settings > "Chat with Companion 🤖".
- **Local AI**: A smart, rule-based chatbot runs entirely in your browser.
- **Privacy**: No user data is sent to any server. No API keys are required.
- **Safety Features**:
    - **Validation**: It listens and validates your feelings using empathetic scripts.
    - **3-Strike System**: If you express severe distress 3 times, it gently suggests professional help.
    - **Crisis Intervention**: Immediate detection of crisis keywords triggers emergency resource cards (988).

### 7. Aesthetic & Design
- **Glassmorphism**: A modern, premium UI style with frosted glass cards and soft shadows.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: The background is a living, breathing gradient that shifts slowly, creating a calming atmosphere.
- **Reduced Motion**: The app respects system-level "Reduced Motion" settings for accessibility.
